# HTML Docs Obsidian Plugin

A zero-dependency minimal plugin to enable .html docs inside Obsidian. Inspired by [Thariq's "unreasonable effectiveness of HTML"](https://x.com/trq212/status/2052809885763747935).


* HTML is rendered in a sandboxed `<iframe>`, and works across tabs, embeds (`![[doc.html]]`), and Canvas.
* JS can run inside the HTML for interactivity but the iframe is isolated from your other notes and Obsidian's own data.
* No other bells and whistles.

The plugin maintains a small TypeScript surface, no runtime dependencies, and cli-driven E2E tests.

## Demo

A demo page (`test/fixture.html`) demonstrates all the passing HTML features.

## Installation

### Install from Obsidian directly

* Go to Obsidian Community Plugins: [community.obsidian.md/plugins/html-docs](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/html-docs)
* Click Install

### Install manually

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/smcllns/obsidian-plugin-html-docs/releases/latest)
2. Place those files into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/html-docs/`.
3. Enable **HTML Docs** in Obsidian's Community Plugins settings.

Releases are built and signed by GitHub Actions ([.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)) so the binaries carry a [build attestation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds) you can verify against the source.

### Build and install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smcllns/obsidian-plugin-html-docs/
npm install
npm run dev      # watch + rebuild
npm run build    # production bundle at `dist/html-docs/`
```

## Test

An E2E test runner validates features, embeds, Canvas cards, and sandboxing are working correctly. Requires `obsidian-cli`, Obsidian running with a vault open, the plugin installed and enabled, and `jq` available.


```bash
npm test
npm run release:check
```

`npm run release:check` runs the production build, the official Obsidian plugin lint rules, and the E2E test. The E2E script builds the current plugin, copies it into the active vault's plugin folder, reloads it, copies `test/fixture.html` into the vault temporarily, opens it in Obsidian, verifies the tab view plus markdown and Canvas embeds, collects the iframe’s own self-test results via `postMessage`, then cleans up.

See `test/fixture.html` for the full list of features exercised — and the inline notes for what is intentionally blocked.

## Usage

After installing the plugin, you can open `.html` files in Obsidian tabs (like a doc), embedded files, and canvas cards.

Obsidian shows `.md` files in the file explorer by default. To see `.html` files too, enable **Settings → Files & links → Show all file types**.

Link to HTML docs with the explicit `.html` extension:

```markdown
See: [[my-doc.html]]
```

Embed HTML docs like other Obsidian embeds. Embeds default to about 600px tall; adjust size with [Obsidian's embed syntax](https://obsidian.md/help/embeds):

```markdown
![[doc.html]]
![[doc.html|600x400]]
```

Each iframe receives a one-way snapshot of Obsidian theme styles. HTML docs can use these CSS variables to match light/dark mode, theme colors, and fonts without giving the iframe permission to read Obsidian or the vault. Use fallbacks so files still work outside Obsidian:

```css
:root {
  color-scheme: var(--obsidian-color-scheme, light dark);
  --bg: var(--obsidian-bg, light-dark(#fff, #0e1014));
  --text: var(--obsidian-text, light-dark(#16161a, #e7e9ec));
}
```

Available CSS variables: `--obsidian-color-scheme`, `--obsidian-bg`, `--obsidian-bg-2`, `--obsidian-text`, `--obsidian-text-muted`, `--obsidian-accent`, `--obsidian-border`, `--obsidian-font`, `--obsidian-font-mono`.

## Known trade-offs

This HTML Docs plugin prioritizes a simple security boundary: HTML runs in a sandboxed iframe with JavaScript allowed, but without same-origin access to Obsidian or the vault.

That keeps HTML documents isolated from your notes and Obsidian internals, with the following trade-offs accepted:

* **Wikilinks to HTML docs need the explicit extension (`[[doc.html]]`).** Extensionless non-Markdown links are not first-class in Obsidian's link index, and click-only plugin handling would leave backlinks and unresolved-link state inconsistent.
* **Links from HTML to Obsidian docs should use Obsidian URI links plus `target="_blank"`.** They hand off to Obsidian without letting the iframe navigate the parent window directly; direct same-tab navigation would require top-navigation sandbox permissions and weaken the boundary.
* **Cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `IndexedDB` are intentionally unavailable.** Enabling them would require same-origin privileges, which would also let HTML share origin with Obsidian instead of staying isolated.
* **Context must be passed into the iframe, the iframe cannot reach out and pull in.** HTML receives curated theme tokens, but cannot inspect Obsidian, other notes, snippets, or local vault files. Use inline CSS/assets, `data:` URLs, or browser-allowed HTTPS URLs instead of vault-relative asset paths.
